# VR_Monitoring_Website

This is the git repository for the WHAM website for VR Monitoring, an ongoing project of Enabling Engineering at
Northeastern University. The project goal is to help Physical Therapists and Cerebral Palsy patients monitor the
progress of the user during virtual reality game play. This will help the users to increase mobility in a non
dominant arm.
